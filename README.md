# Huffmann-Coding


A c++ program to compresses and decompresses files using Huffman algorithm.
This project is to design compression and decompression programs based on Huffman Coding.
The idea of Huffman Coding is to minimize the weighted expected length of the code by 
assigning shorter codes to frequently-used characters and longer codes to less-used charecters.



# Steps:

1.  First We Take the input text
2.  Then we build Huffman tree for each unique charecter using Huffman algorithm
3.  In the next step we call Encode function to encode the sample input
4.  Thus we get the encoded string
5.  Next we call decode function to get back the decoded string


# The Code is added with a lot of comments for better understanding
