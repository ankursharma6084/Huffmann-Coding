# Huffmann-Coding


A c++ program to compresses and decompresses files using Huffman algorithm.



# Steps:

1.  First We Take the input text
2.  Then we build Huffman tree for each unique charecter using Huffman algorithm
3.  In the next step we call Encode function to encode the sample input
4.  Thus we get the encoded string
5.  Next we call decode function to get back the decoded string


# The Code is added with a lot of comments for better understanding
